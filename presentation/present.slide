* Recap

Your current pipeline:

  Github -->   CircleCI   -->     Quay.io     --> Kubernetes
              â†³ Architect       â†³ Clair scan     â†³ Draughtman

Proposed pipeline:

  Github -->   CircleCI   --> Any registry --> Kubernetes
              â†³ Architect                               â†³ Draughtman
                 Clairctl
                    â†³ Clair

** Questions 

- What is *architect*? Could I use it?
- What is *draughtman*?

* How did you interpret the task?

** Assumption

- * Real Need *
- Quay.io is expensive, need alternative

* How did you decide on the design for clairctl?

* Why?

- Weekend project (working on during commute)
- Learn Go
- CLI, I ðŸ–¤ CLI

* Clairctl features

- Push *From* any registry (almost) *To* `Clair` server 
- Analyze local image before pushing it on a registry
- Generate HTML report

.link report.html

* Clairctl - Limitation

- Many user complains about Error 400 on Clair (reverse proxy and authentication)
- For local analysis, `Clairctl` machine should be visible by `Clair` server
- Amazon ECR login not working
- Time to work on

* Clairctl - Future

- gRPC for Clair 3.0 (push layer implementation)
- Integrate seamlessly with cluster manager like Kubernetes (PR on going)
- Auto-Setup
- Better integration with CI system
